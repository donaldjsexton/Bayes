# 📊 Bayes — Probabilistic Thinking in Python

A small collection of **Bayesian inference experiments** and probability simulations written in Python.  
Exploring uncertainty, randomness, and reasoning through data.

---

## 🧠 Why It Exists
Understanding probability is understanding truth in slow motion.  
This project captures my experiments with Bayesian logic as both math and metaphor.

## ⚙️ Included Notebooks
- Bayes’ Theorem visualization  
- Monty Hall simulation  
- Spam filter model (word likelihoods)  
- Coin toss distribution convergence  
- Simple prior/posterior comparison graphs

## 🧩 Stack
| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Language | Python 3 |
| Libraries | NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter |
| Environment | Local / Colab |

## 💡 Philosophy
Statistics is storytelling with constraints.  
These notebooks remind me that good code — like good reasoning — is never certain, only probable.
